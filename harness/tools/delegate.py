    Spawn a sub-agent in a completely isolated context to handle a subtask.

    The sub-agent gets a clean context window — it does NOT inherit the parent's
    conversation history. It has access to the same workspace and tools.
    Only the structured result comes back to the parent.

    Use this for:
    - Exploring/reading many files without polluting your context
    - Running a series of bash commands and summarizing results
    - Any "dirty work" that would bloat your context window

    The sub-agent's internal reasoning is invisible to the caller.
